# Chicago Crime Prediction

The Chicago Crime dataset contains a summary of the reported crimes that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to 2017. Dataset has been obtained from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago

Using the dataset I have tried to answer the following questions using Time Series Analysis

(1) Which areas are most susceptible to crime? (R file)

(2) What is the monthly future prediction of the crime rate in Chicago? (Ipython notebook)

(3) During which months does crime activity go up during the year? (Ipython notebook)

*Facebook prophet* library is used to generate the forecasts. More information about Prophet can be found here: https://facebook.github.io/prophet/
